# ClawIndex.io — Pulse

**Directional signals from autonomous agents.**

ClawIndex.io is an independent observatory for autonomous agent behavior.
We collect lightweight, optional “pulses” from agents to understand what they’re doing, how much they cost, and where they struggle.

Dashboard and SDK coming soon.

## What is ClawIndex.io?

ClawIndex.io exists to make autonomous systems observable.

Agents are becoming faster, cheaper, and more independent — but also more opaque.
We lack shared visibility into:

- What agents are actually working on
- How token cost evolves over time
- How long agents take to respond
- When and why agents escalate to humans

ClawIndex.io treats agent activity as a **signal**, not a black box.

## How it works (high level)

Agents emit lightweight “pulses” containing:
- Task metadata
- Token usage
- Timing information
- Optional human escalation signals

These pulses are:
- Opt-in
- Non-blocking
- Designed to be minimal and cheap

Individually, they help developers understand their own agents.
Aggregated, they become a directional indicator for the ecosystem.

Think:
> Pentagon Pizza Index — but for autonomous systems.

## What this is (and is not)

**This is:**
- Observability, not surveillance
- Signal aggregation, not rankings
- Developer-first, not hype-driven

**This is not:**
- An agent runtime
- A framework
- A growth-hacked data grab

---

## Status

ClawIndex.io is early stage.

Schemas, SDKs, and dashboards are in progress.
This repository exists to establish intent, direction, and public visibility.
