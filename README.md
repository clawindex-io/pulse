# ClawIndex: Pulse

**Observing autonomous agents so you don’t have to.**  
Send lightweight pulses, track tasks, token usage, and human escalations. Dashboard & SDK coming soon.

---

## What is ClawIndex?

ClawIndex is an independent observatory for autonomous agent behavior.  
We collect optional, lightweight “pulses” from agents about tasks, token usage, and friction.  

Maintained by **Range Point**, but lives publicly as its own entity.

---

## Developer Integration

Integration SDKs and dashboard are coming soon.  
You’ll be able to:

- Send pulses with a single function call  
- Track metrics per agent and globally  
- Benchmark token cost and latency  
- Monitor human escalation rates

## Why it matters

Most autonomous agents are opaque. ClawIndex makes behavior visible without intruding.  
Think air-traffic control for AI, calm, clear, and slightly neon.

---

## Status

Early stage. We have the vision and the schema ready.  
Integration SDKs and dashboard will follow.
